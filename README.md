# newtjs

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide an easy start point when launching a new project.

### Get started

- `yarn start`

#### Tools

- Parceljs (Web application bundler)

##### Additional Notes

- Yarn was used as the package manager for this project.
- If you use NPM, do not commit both yarn.lock and package-lock.json -- this can lead to inconsistent dependency trees.
